## User Journeys
Bill is a student at Make School who lives on the fifth floor at 851 California. Oftentimes, Bill takes all of his laundries down to the washers to see them all in use, and sometimes, washers with no time left and someone's wet clothes waiting inside for a long time. Bill is frustrated and looking for a new way to check which washers and dryers are in use before walking all the way down. Bill finds 'Make Laundry' which provides real-time countdowns and statuses on each laundry machine at 851 California.

Sarah is a student at FIDM in San Francisco who lives on the fourth floor at 851 California. Sarah is very forgetful and goes onto the next thing after starting a load of laundry. Once her washer load is done, her wet clothes remain in there while other students are trying to access the washer. Sarah is looking for a new way to get a reminder when her clothes are almost done in the wash. She'd also like to check washer statuses before walking all the way down. Sarah hears about 'Make Laundry' where she can add her wash details for everyone to see, and receive a reminder when the machine is done.
